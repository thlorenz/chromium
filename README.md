# chromium

Collecting patches I applied to local chromium checkout (pushing the actual repo to github is not allowed since it
exceeds maximum allowed size).

Additionally documenting inner workings of chromium mainly related to debugging, profiling and devtools.

## Patches

Patches are based off the blink branch on top of commit `d9ab67759f6cd14a7f323a2134b6982f2dc7ed10` and ordered oldest to
newest and are generated via `git format-patch -1 <sha>`
